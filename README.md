# 🎴 DeckPuller

### Pull your Magic: The Gathering decks from paper, one card at a time.

Import a deck from [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com), then tap your way through it as you physically pull each card from your collection — with live progress, card images, and everything saved per deck.

## ✨ What it does

Building a physical MTG deck from a list is tedious — you scan a decklist, hunt through binders, and lose your place. **DeckPuller** turns that into a tap-to-track checklist:

- Pull a deck straight from **Archidekt** (paste a URL, or browse your own decks by username).
- Cards are grouped by type and shown with their real art (via **Scryfall**).
- Tap a card to mark one pulled; the progress bar and per-card counters update instantly.
- Everything is saved locally, **per deck**, so you can stop and resume anytime.
- Finish a deck and you get a little confetti moment. 🎉

## 🚀 Features

- **📚 Multiple decks** — keep as many decks as you like, each with its own saved pull progress.
- **🔗 Import from Archidekt** — paste a deck URL, or enter your Archidekt username and pick from your public decks (the username is remembered).
- **🖼️ Real card images** — fetched and cached from Scryfall; tap any card to see it full-size.
- **🗂️ Grouped & sorted** — cards are organized by type (Creatures, Instants, Lands, …) with sticky headers.
- **🔎 Search** — filter the current deck by card name; the keyboard pops up the moment you open it.
- **🔄 Refresh** — re-sync a deck from Archidekt **without losing your pulled progress**.
- **♻️ Reset** — zero-out a deck's progress (with a confirmation), ready for the next build.
- **💾 Offline-friendly progress** — pull counts live in a local database and survive restarts.
- **🎉 Completion celebration** — confetti when a deck hits 100%.
- **🌙 Modern Material 3 UI** — edge-to-edge, dark-theme-first, with a speed-dial action button.

## 🧭 How pulling works

1. **Add a deck** from the deck list (the `+` button) — by URL or by browsing your Archidekt username.
2. DeckPuller fetches the decklist from Archidekt and enriches each card with art/type data from Scryfall.
3. On the **pull screen**, tap a card row to increment its pulled count; use the `−` button to back one out.
4. The header shows overall `pulled / total` and a percentage; each card shows `pulled / required`.
5. Pull everything and enjoy the confetti — the deck stays in your list at 100% for next time.

The bottom-right **speed-dial** holds Search, Refresh, Reset, and Add-deck so the card list stays clean.

## 🏗️ Architecture & tech stack

DeckPuller is a single-module Android app following an MVVM + repository pattern with a clear data / domain / ui split.

| Layer | What's there |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI** | Jetpack Compose (Material 3), Navigation-Compose, screen-scoped `ViewModel`s exposing `StateFlow` |
| **Domain** | Plain Kotlin models (`Deck`, `DeckCard`, `DeckSummary`), card-type classification & grouping |
| **Data** | Repository over Retrofit APIs + a Room database; DataStore for preferences; Coil for images |

**Built with:**
- **Kotlin 2.0** · **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3) · **Navigation-Compose**
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room** for local persistence (decks + per-card progress)
- **Retrofit + kotlinx.serialization** for the Archidekt & Scryfall APIs
- **Coil** for card image loading/caching
- **DataStore (Preferences)** for the saved Archidekt username
- **Coroutines / Flow** throughout
- **konfetti** for the completion celebration
- **Robolectric · JUnit4 · Turbine · MockK** for tests

## 🛠️ Building & running

**Requirements:** Android Studio (Ladybug or newer), JDK 17, Android SDK 35.

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:tahuffman1s/Deckpuller.git
cd Deckpuller

# Build a debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install on a connected device / emulator
./gradlew :app:installDebug

# Run the unit test suite (Robolectric)
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

Or just open the project in Android Studio and hit **Run**.

## 🔁 CI / CD

GitHub Actions runs two pipelines:

- **CI** — on every push/PR to `main`: Android Lint → unit tests → debug APK, with the APK and test/lint reports uploaded as artifacts.
- **Release** — on a `v*` tag (or manual dispatch): builds a **signed** release **APK + AAB** and publishes a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.

Cut a release by tagging:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

See **[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md)** for the one-time signing-secret setup and full details.

## 🔌 Data sources

- **[Archidekt](https://archidekt.com)** — deck lists, via its public (unofficial) API.
- **[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)** — card metadata and images.

> **Note on Archidekt accounts:** Archidekt has no official OAuth for third-party apps, so DeckPuller can only browse your **public** decks (by username) — there's no login and private decks aren't accessible. You can always import any deck directly by URL.
